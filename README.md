# thoughtware

> “Even if not true, it’s symbolic. It’s nice to think about.”

**thoughtware** is a living system where code, cognition, and creativity merge.  
It treats tools as mind extensions, data as reality, and AI as mirrors of thought.

---

## 🧭 Intent

- Turn stream-of-thought into modular systems
- Build tools where philosophy becomes usable and visual
- Run experiments connecting ideas, code, and interfaces
- Engineer metaphors into real software

## 🌱 Core Themes

- **Simplicity in Tools** → Interface friction = mind friction
- **Laptop as Self** → Your OS = your mental environment
- **LLMs as Mirrors** → Memory is programmable
- **Infinity & Reality** → Time = navigation, truth = compression
- **Metaphor as Infrastructure** → Metaphors can become working systems

## 🧩 From Thought to Tools

| Thought                      | Tool / Research Area                    |
|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Tools as consciousness nodes | Neuro-symbolic systems, local LLMs      |
| Compressing experience       | Kolmogorov Complexity, symbolic models  |
| Quantum path traversal       | Fourier analysis, causal graphs         |
| Mind ↔ Interface unification | Plotly dashboards, LangGraph, local vectors |

## 🌀 What This Is NOT

- Not a belief system
- Not pseudoscience
- Not performance art
- This is thoughtful speculation backed by code and research — meant to be explored, tested, and visualized.

---

## 📚 References

- See `/references/theory-links.md`
- Links to theories, papers, and thinkers (e.g. IIT, Block Universe, Borges)

## 💡 To Read First

- Andy Clark & David Chalmers: *The Extended Mind*
- Giulio Tononi: Integrated Information Theory (IIT)
- Jorge Luis Borges: *The Garden of Forking Paths*
- Bret Victor: Explorable Explanations
- Douglas Hofstadter: *Gödel, Escher, Bach* (GEB)

## 🔮 Future Directions

- Build a visual knowledge interface (thought → plot → agent)
- Deploy as a public webbook or digital garden
- Turn essays into videos, narrations, AI companions
- Develop evolving agents to co-write your thought stream

So this ☝️ is the manifest of my first raw thought. It should all start connecting on the way.

Also, just watched *Ready Player One*, convinced that I need to read it too.  
Which led me to think it’s wild to be “stuck in this thought” while we have jet planes going over 10,000 km/h.  

Is there still time?
